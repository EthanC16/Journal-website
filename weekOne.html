        <h2>Introduction to the course</h2>
        <p>Sessions will take place from 9:30 until 4:30 each day.</p>
        <p>This first day took us through a bit about the course, how we will take part in working through a full stack,
            getting us ready with the required programs and a quick intro to JavaScript</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>What is a full stack?</h3>
        <p>Client Browers are the top level</p>
        <p>The next level is an API</p>
        <p>A request/response is the link between an API and the client browsers</p>
        <p>An API is an aplication programming interface, a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk
            to each other. Some examples are Node.js, express.js and Mongoose.js</p>
        <p>The bottom level is a database, this being MongoDB database on ATLAS</p>
        <p>The last 2 weeks of the course will be to build a full stack as a group</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>What programs did we download?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>VS Code - I already had this installed and had some previous experience with it</li>
            <li>Github desktop</li>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Day 1 intro to JavaScript</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>The MERN stack</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mongo</li>
            <li>Express</li>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>Node</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Dot Notation</h3>
        <p>The dot notation approach involves using a dot. and a key to access a property</p>
        <p>object.propertyName</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Data types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Strings - for representing text</li>
            <li>Numbers - for representing numbers</li>
            <li>Boolean - for true and false</li>
            <li>undefined - </li>
            <li>Null - for nothing</li>
            <li>Symbol - key for an object property when the property is intended to be private</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Libraries</h3>
        <p>Features that we don't have to do ourselves - prewritten code</p>
        <p>An example of this is console.log(Math.random())</p>
        <p>We explored some of these libraries using code such as Math.round and Math.floor</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Day 2</h2>
        <p>This was our first day with Leon and was our first full day of exploing JavaScript</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>We use variables to store items in boxes to retrieve later. We can give variables names so we can access
            things later</p>
        <p>This was quite confusing at first, especially with it being my proper first go at JavaScript, but I feel that
            over the course of day I already became a bit familiar with some of the key concepts</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Declerations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Let - is used for declaring a value that <strong>can</strong> be changed</li>
            <li>Const - used for declaring a value that <strong>cannot</strong> be changed</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>+ Addition</li>
            <li>- Subtraction</li>
            <li>* Multiplication</li>
            <li>** Exponentiation</li>
            <li>/ Division</li>
            <li>% Modulus</li>
            <li>++ Increment</li>
            <li>__ Decrement</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Commenting Out</h3>
        <p>This is a very useful way of making comments along with code. I have used this a bit on some of the more
            confusing parts. Also worth noting that through the during of the course I decided to make a lot of notes
            using pen and paper, which is what i'm then adding to this journal.</p>
        <p>To comment out on JavaScript we can use // for one line and */ for multiple lines. We can also use Ctrl /
            after highlighting to comment all that out.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Camel Case</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All start with a lowercase letter</li>
            <li>No space between the next word</li>
            <li>The next word starting in uppercase</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Template literals</h3>
        <p>These are literals delimited with backtick ` characters. An example of this is `my name is ${myName}`</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>if Else</h3>
        <p>Allows specific pieces of code to run if conditions are met. E.g if (its raining) {`umbrella`} else {`no
            umbrella`}. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Day 3</h2>
        <p>Day 3 was to look at arrays and loops, our learning objects were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create an array</li>
            <li>Research and use array methods</li>
            <li>Write programs with 'for' loops and 'while' loops</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>Arrays use [square brackets] with commas to seperate items. This is not just a variable, but a variable that
            now holds multiple items</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><strong>An important note (I think) is that index starts at 0</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>The terminal/command prompt</h3>
        <p>We ended day 3 with looking at the command prompt terminal and how to use it to navigate files and folders
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>cd - change directory</li>
            <li>dir - show you files where you currently are</li>
            <li>mkdir - make directory, to create folders</li>
            <li>echo.>filename - create files</li>
            <li>rm - remove</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Day 4</h2>
        <p>As we started the course on a tuesday this was the final day of the first week, it also meant that this days
            afternoon session was spent (for the first time) with Zoe from the employability team.</p>
        <p>The morning began with functions, and in the afternoon session we took a look at CVs</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>The 3 functions we can use are decleration, expression and arrow. We will primarly use the arrow function
            throughout this course.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Decleration</li>
            <p>Created with the function keyword. They are hoisted, meaning they can be called before they are declared
                in the code.</p>
            <li>Expression</li>
            <p>Define functions as part of an expression. When you need to assign a function to a varibale or pass it as
                an argument to another function</p>
            <li>Arrow</li>
            <p>Provide a concise syntax for writing functions. Commonly used in array methods or as a concise callback
                function.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>I think functions are probably something I maybe need to practice just to make sure I am familiar with them.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Intro to employability</h3>
        <p>Are usual session for meeting with the employability are to be on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. However as
            this first week began on a tuesday (due to the bank holiday) our first session was moved to firday
            afternoon. <strong>Note</strong>, I think this will be an important section of the course for me, but also
            worth noting that I have been through employability stuff at uni, as well as doing quite a bit of research.
            I have previously worked on a CV along with multiple iterations of cover letters (I have a strong dislike
            for these which my become apparant throughout this journal) so I feel like i'm in a good starting place.
        </p>
        <p>We started by looking at different types of CVs, the meaning note I made for this was on 'Technical CVs' as I
            haven't really explored this before. These types of CVs are used for highlighting key specific technical
            skills, such as software and platforms. Important also to make use of portfolios and githubs.
        </p>
        <p>I made plenty of notes that feature about making sure our CVs are relevant and relate back to the job
            descriptions.</p>
        <p>KPIs were mentioned as a way to show the positive impact that we could have had, this is not something I have
            thought about before so maybe something I should explore more.</p>
        <p>The final notes I made for week 1 were on gaps in our CVs. With these we should be transparent and explain
            any gaps clearly and how we may have used the time effectively.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>How I found week 1</h2>
        <p>I think this was a good start to the course, there were a few times I felt like some of the things were a bit
            difficult, but after some tinkering and problem solving I managed to end the week with no outstanding
            problems and felt like I had made a good start. This was my first intro to JavaScript so it was interesting
            to get to grips and learn the fundamentals.</p>
