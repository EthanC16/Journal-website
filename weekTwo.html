    <h1>Week 2</h1>
</div>
    <div>
        <nav class="topnav">
            <a href="index.html">HOME</a>
            <a href="weekOne.html">WEEK 1</a>
        </nav>
    </div>
<div>
    <h2>Week 2's focus is on HTML & CSS</h2>
    <p>I think this will be a nice week for me, due to having past experience with both HTML and CSS. I think it will be more of a refresher and practice which I think I need.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>(Day 1) Github</h3>
    <p>This week starts with an introduction to Github and github repositories. I have used Github before for a university website project but I can't really remember much of it. We needed to use a repository to put our code, from the challenges we got set the previous week, online</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>JS Objects</h3>
    <p>I had some time after finishing tasks to get some research done on JavaScript Objects.</p>
    <p>An example I found online compared JS Objects to a car. In real life, a car is an object. A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop. All cars have the same properties but the property values differ from car to car. All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.</p>
    <p>Objects are variables, but can contain many values.</p>
    <p>It is common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Object Methods</h3>
    <p>Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. They are stored in properties as function definitions.</p>
    <p><strong>this</strong> is a keyword that refers to an object.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Day 2 - Databases and employability</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Day 2 began with are first proper session with Paul. We started with an intro to SQL.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Types of data</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>numeric data</p>
        <li>INT - integer whole numbers</li>
        <li>FLOAT - floating point</li>
        <li>DECIMAL - decimal numbers</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p>string data</p>
        <li>CHAR</li>
        <li>VARCHAR</li>
        <li>DATE - yyyy/mm/dd</li>
        <li>BOOLEAN - true / false</li>
    </ul>
<p>This is something I need to revisit</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Primary Key</h3>
    <p>In a database, a key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identify each row in a table. Keys are used to establish tables, enforce data itegrity and provide quick access to data.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>DMS & SQL</h3>
    <p>DMS stands for database management systems, they are systems used to manage and organise data in a database.</p>
    <p>SQL is a declerative programming language used to manage and manipulate data stored in relational databases.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Using mycompiler</h3>
<p>We had a play around with SQL using the website mycompiler. We had a go at creating a table and add/manipulating values stored. At first I had some issues with getting errors back after running it, but eventually I found that I was missing some things such as colons, speech marks or brackets. So I think it's important with this to double check becuase it seems quite easy to miss things out.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Day 2's employability session</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>This session was on the dreaded cover letter. It was also the first time we got split into a quick team call to have a chat with another person about some questions on cover letters.</p>
