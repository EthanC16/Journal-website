    <h2>Week 2's focus is on HTML & CSS</h2>
    <p>I think this will be a nice week for me, due to having past experience with both HTML and CSS. I think it will be more of a refresher and practice which I think I need.</p>

    <h3>(Day 1) Github</h3>
    <p>This week starts with an introduction to Github and github repositories. I have used Github before for a university website project but I can't really remember much of it. We needed to use a repository to put our code, from the challenges we got set the previous week, online</p>

    <h3>JS Objects</h3>
    <p>I had some time after finishing tasks to get some research done on JavaScript Objects.</p>
    <p>An example I found online compared JS Objects to a car. In real life, a car is an object. A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop. All cars have the same properties but the property values differ from car to car. All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.</p>
    <p>Objects are variables, but can contain many values.</p>
    <p>It is common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.</p>
