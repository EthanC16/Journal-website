            I am taking part in the Growth Company's 12 week software bootcamp and during the course of this I will be
            adding to and creating this web journal. A lot of the notes featured throughout this website is transfered
            from the notes I have been taking, using a pen and paper. I thought it might be useful to add the notes to
            this web site as; it should help with remembering the topics featured, I can revisit anything I have found
            difficult and also to make sure that if anything was to happen to my notebook I have all the notes on here.
            I have also made comments within these notes detailing my thoughts on how things were going and what I
            though about certain topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 12 week skills bootcamp is designed to equip learners with the skills and knowledge required to start a
            career in software development.
