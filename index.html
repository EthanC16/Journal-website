        I am taking part in the Growth Company's 12 week sofwtare bootcamp and during the course of this I will be adding to and creating this web journal. A lot of the notes featured throughout this website is transfered from the notes I have been taking, using a pen and paper. I thought it might be useful to add the notes to this web site as; it should help with remembering the topics featured, I can revisit anything I have found difficult and also to make sure that if anything was to happen to my notebook I have all the notes on here. I have also made comments within these notes detailing my thoughts on how things were going and what I though about certain topics.

        The 12 week skills bootcamp is designed to equip learners with the skills and knowledge required to start a career in software development.
